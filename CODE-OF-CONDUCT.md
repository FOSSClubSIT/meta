**The FOSS Club SIT Code of Conduct**


Message from the organizers.
We invite you to be part of FOSS Club SIT, our forum, social channels, and other community gatherings in a spirit of curiosity, unity, dignity, and open-mindedness. FOSS Club SIT is an organization for collaboration, for building free software and open communities, and to ensure the quality of such conversations, there are certain rules that we, and you, are expected to follow. All Club members and volunteers at our events are required to agree with the following code of conduct. We expect cooperation from all members to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

FOSS Club SIT is dedicated to providing an environment where: -
1.	Harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion.
2.	Being respectful of otherâ€™s ideas, contribution regardless of their background.
3.	Members are mindful of their language and behavior, refraining from any form of discrimination, harassment, or intimidation.
4.	Engaging in any form of violence, threats, or intimidation is unacceptable.
5.	Everyone feels safe to express themselves.

We do not tolerate harassment of members, volunteers, sponsors, or anyone else associated with the community in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled at the discretion of the club. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the FOSS Club SIT team may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the club depending on the severity of the offence. Members asked to stop any such behavior are expected to comply immediately.
The code of conduct and anti-harassment policies apply to everyone participating in the event including volunteers, sponsors, and FOSS Club SIT staff.
Regardless of the event being a virtual or online-only event, we expect participants to adhere to these rules at all avenues, online and offline alike.
If you feel uncomfortable or harassed at any of our events or communication channels, please report it to the club using the procedures mentioned below.
